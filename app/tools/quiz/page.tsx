            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-3">Why Aptitude Test Practice Matters</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Aptitude tests are now standard in graduate recruitment across virtually every major industry. Leading firms use them to screen thousands of applications quickly, measuring candidates on numerical reasoning, verbal reasoning, logical and inductive reasoning, situational judgment (SJTs), and diagrammatic reasoning.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6">
              At firms like KPMG, the numerical and verbal sections each contain 24 questions in 20 minutes. At EY, the One Assessment delivers roughly 8 questions in 6 minutes per sub-section. Rejection rates at top firms can reach 50–80% at the screening stage — consistent, targeted <strong>aptitude test practice</strong> is the single most effective way to improve your odds. Users on our platform report doubling their interview invite rate after completing just 10 full mock tests.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-3">Preparation Tips for Aptitude Tests</h3>
            <p className="mb-2"><strong>Practice daily.</strong> Dedicate 1–2 hours per day in the two to three weeks before your test.</p>
            <p className="mb-2"><strong>Time yourself from day one.</strong> Working slowly on untimed practice builds false confidence. Practice under real exam pressure from your first session.</p>
            <p className="mb-2"><strong>Review every error.</strong> Use our AI feedback to understand not just the correct answer, but why alternative options are wrong.</p>
            <p className="mb-6"><strong>Simulate full assessments.</strong> Complete both objective and theory sections together to build the stamina needed for a real recruitment day.</p>
