      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Top Industries Hiring in Spain</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">Tourism and hospitality remain Spain's most iconic industries — the country welcomes 85 million visitors annually, making it one of the world's top tourist destinations and creating massive demand for hospitality, events, and travel management professionals. Renewable energy is Spain's fastest-growing sector, with Iberdrola, Acciona, and Repsol driving enormous investment in wind, solar, and green hydrogen and creating thousands of <strong>engineering and sustainability jobs in Spain</strong>. Technology is growing rapidly in Barcelona and Madrid, with a vibrant startup scene and major tech companies establishing southern European hubs. Financial services, retail, and healthcare are also consistent employers.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Best Cities for Jobs in Spain</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">Madrid is Spain's capital and largest employment centre, home to the headquarters of Santander, BBVA, Telefónica, Inditex, and Repsol, alongside a growing technology corridor. <strong>Jobs in Madrid</strong> span finance, technology, consulting, retail, and the public sector. Barcelona is Spain's tech and startup capital, with a thriving ecosystem in mobile technology, e-commerce, and digital media — and a large concentration of international companies that operate in English.

Seville and Málaga are growing technology and digital nomad destinations.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Working in Spain as an International Professional</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">EU and EEA nationals have full freedom of movement to work in Spain. Non-EU professionals require a work visa, and Spain introduced the <strong>Digital Nomad Visa</strong> in 2023, allowing remote workers and freelancers earning primarily from outside Spain to live and work legally in the country. The <strong>Highly Qualified Professional Visa</strong> provides an accelerated route for skilled workers with a job offer from a Spanish employer. Many Barcelona-based tech companies actively hire English-speaking professionals, particularly in software development, product management, and growth marketing.</p>
