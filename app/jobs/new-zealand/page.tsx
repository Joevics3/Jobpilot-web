      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Finding Jobs in New Zealand</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">New Zealand offers an exceptional quality of life alongside a robust and growing job market. With a population of five million and significant skills shortages across healthcare, construction, engineering, and technology, New Zealand actively recruits internationally and offers transparent pathways for skilled migrants. JobMeter aggregates <strong>current job vacancies in New Zealand</strong> from verified employers across the North and South Islands, updated daily.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Top Industries Hiring in New Zealand</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">Healthcare is New Zealand's most critical hiring sector, with persistent shortages of nurses, GPs, specialists, and allied health professionals driving active international recruitment. Construction and infrastructure are booming, fuelled by a national housing shortage and significant government infrastructure investment. Technology is growing rapidly, with Auckland and Wellington developing strong startup and scale-up ecosystems. Agriculture, food production, and agritech underpin the export economy. Education, tourism, and the public service are also consistent employers.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Best Cities for Jobs in New Zealand</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">Auckland is New Zealand's largest city and commercial capital, accounting for around a third of the national workforce. <strong>Jobs in Auckland</strong> are most abundant in technology, finance, professional services, and healthcare. Wellington, the capital, is home to the central government, public service, and a growing technology and creative sector. Christchurch is the South Island's economic hub, with strong construction, engineering, and agricultural sectors. Hamilton and Tauranga are fast-growing cities with increasing employment in logistics, manufacturing, and agribusiness.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">New Zealand Work Visas and Immigration</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">New Zealand's <strong>Skilled Migrant Category Resident Visa</strong> uses a points-based system for permanent residency. The <strong>Accredited Employer Work Visa (AEWV)</strong> is the primary temporary work visa, requiring a job offer from an Immigration New Zealand-accredited employer. Many healthcare roles qualify for <strong>straight-to-residence</strong> pathways given the severity of shortages. The <strong>Green List</strong> identifies occupations in highest demand, offering faster residency processing. Many listings on JobMeter note whether New Zealand work visa support is available.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Salary Expectations for Jobs in New Zealand</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">New Zealand's minimum wage is NZD $23.15 per hour. <strong>Software engineers in Auckland</strong> typically earn NZD $90,000–$130,000.

Finance professionals at major New Zealand banks earn NZD $70,000–$120,000. Salaries are generally lower than Australia but offset by lower living costs outside Auckland and an exceptional natural environment and lifestyle.</p>
