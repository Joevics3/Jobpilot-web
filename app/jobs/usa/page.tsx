      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">The United States remains the world's largest job market, with over 160 million people in the workforce and hundreds of thousands of new positions posted every month. Whether you're searching for <strong>entry-level jobs in the USA</strong>, <strong>remote jobs for international applicants</strong>, or senior roles at leading American corporations, the breadth of opportunity is unmatched.

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Top Industries Hiring in the USA</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">The U.S. job market is led by technology, which continues to dominate hiring in cities like San Francisco, Seattle, Austin, and New York. <strong>Software engineer jobs in the USA</strong>, <strong>data scientist roles</strong>, and <strong>product manager positions</strong> are among the most searched across the country. Healthcare is the second-largest employer, with <strong>registered nurse jobs</strong>, <strong>physician assistant roles</strong>, and <strong>healthcare administrator positions</strong> in constant demand due to an ageing population. Finance and banking, defence contracting, logistics, and renewable energy round out the fastest-growing sectors for 2024 and beyond.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Best Cities for Jobs in the USA</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">New York City leads in finance, media, and professional services, with Wall Street firms and global consultancies hiring year-round. San Francisco and the broader Bay Area remain the epicentre of the global tech industry, hosting the headquarters of Apple, Google, Meta, and thousands of venture-backed startups. Austin, Texas has emerged as a major tech and manufacturing hub, attracting Tesla, Dell, and a growing number of Silicon Valley relocations. Washington D.C. offers the highest concentration of <strong>government and federal contractor jobs</strong> in the country. Chicago leads in trading, logistics, and manufacturing, while Boston is a world leader in biotech, pharmaceuticals, and academic research.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Work Visas and Employment Authorization in the USA</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">International candidates searching for <strong>H-1B visa sponsored jobs in the USA</strong> will find that the technology, engineering, and healthcare sectors offer the highest number of sponsorship-eligible roles. The H-1B remains the primary work visa for specialty occupations, though the annual cap means competition is high. Other pathways include the L-1 intracompany transfer visa, O-1 for extraordinary ability, and the TN visa for Canadian and Mexican nationals under the USMCA agreement. Many listings on JobMeter indicate visa sponsorship availability directly in the job details.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Salary Expectations for Jobs in the USA</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">Salaries in the United States vary significantly by state, industry, and experience level. The median household income sits around $75,000 per year, but technology roles routinely exceed this — <strong>senior software engineers in San Francisco</strong> often earn $180,000–$250,000 in base salary alone, before equity and bonuses. Entry-level marketing roles average $45,000–$60,000, while experienced product managers at major tech firms command $150,000–$200,000. Healthcare salaries are driven by specialisation: surgeons average over $300,000, while registered nurses earn $70,000–$100,000 depending on location. Use JobMeter's salary filters to find roles that match your expectations.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Remote Jobs Based in the USA</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">The pandemic permanently shifted American work culture, with <strong>remote and hybrid jobs in the USA</strong> now standard across technology, finance, marketing, and customer success. Platforms like JobMeter make it easy to filter exclusively for remote-eligible roles. Many U.S. employers now hire internationally for remote positions, making American companies accessible to skilled workers worldwide. Common fully remote roles include software development, UX design, digital marketing, content creation, data analysis, and customer support.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">How to Apply for Jobs in the USA</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">A strong American-format resume (typically one to two pages, no photo, with clear achievement-based bullet points) is essential. LinkedIn is widely used by U.S. recruiters and is often the first place they verify candidates. Tailoring your cover letter to the specific company and role significantly increases response rates. For senior and executive positions, networking through industry events, alumni connections, and LinkedIn outreach often outperforms direct applications. Once you find a role on JobMeter, click through to the employer's application page for full instructions.</p>
