      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Finding Jobs in Germany</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">Germany is Europe's largest economy and one of the world's most significant job markets, with over 45 million employed workers and a persistent structural shortage of skilled professionals across engineering, technology, and healthcare. Germany's <em>Fachkräftemangel</em> — skilled worker shortage — has prompted the government to actively recruit internationally, making it one of the most accessible European countries for skilled migration. JobMeter aggregates <strong>current job vacancies in Germany</strong> from verified employers across all major cities and regions.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Top Industries Hiring in Germany</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">Engineering and manufacturing are Germany's most iconic industries, anchored by automotive giants BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and their vast supplier networks, alongside industrial conglomerates like Siemens, Bosch, and Thyssenkrupp. <strong>Engineering jobs in Germany</strong> — mechanical, electrical, software, and civil — are among the most in-demand in Europe. The technology sector is expanding rapidly, particularly in Berlin, which has become one of Europe's top startup ecosystems. Finance and banking are centred in Frankfurt, Europe's second-largest financial centre. Healthcare, pharmaceutical (Bayer, BASF), and research institutions also employ at scale.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Best Cities for Jobs in Germany</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">Berlin is Germany's capital and its largest startup hub, with a thriving tech scene, creative industries, and a growing number of international company headquarters. <strong>Jobs in Berlin</strong> are particularly abundant in technology, media, e-commerce, and the arts. Munich is Germany's wealthiest city and home to BMW, Allianz, and MAN, along with a strong technology and consulting sector. Frankfurt is the financial capital, home to the ECB, Deutsche Bank, and major global banks' European headquarters. Hamburg is Germany's second-largest city and a hub for media, logistics, and maritime industries. Stuttgart anchors the automotive and engineering heartland.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Working in Germany as an International Professional</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">Germany introduced the <strong>Skilled Immigration Act (Fachkräfteeinwanderungsgesetz)</strong> to streamline work permits for non-EU nationals. The <strong>EU Blue Card</strong> remains the most popular route for university-educated professionals earning above the salary threshold (€43,800 in most fields, lower for shortage occupations). The <strong>Chancenkarte (Opportunity Card)</strong>, introduced in 2024, allows skilled workers to enter Germany to search for a job without a prior offer. Many <strong>jobs in Germany for English speakers</strong> are available in technology companies, international consultancies, and multinational corporations where English is the working language.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Salary Expectations for Jobs in Germany</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">Germany's minimum wage is €12.41 per hour. Professional salaries are solid though typically lower than equivalent roles in the UK or USA — offset significantly by Germany's exceptional social benefits, healthcare system, and work-life balance. <strong>Software engineers in Berlin</strong> typically earn €55,000–€90,000. Automotive engineers at OEMs earn €60,000–€95,000. Finance professionals in Frankfurt earn €65,000–€120,000. Doctors and specialists in Germany earn €70,000–€150,000 depending on specialism and seniority.</p>
