      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Top Industries Hiring in Canada</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">Technology is the fastest-growing sector, centred in Toronto's MaRS Discovery District, Vancouver's growing tech corridor, and Montreal's AI research ecosystem — home to institutions like Mila and several major AI labs. Healthcare is Canada's single largest employer, with persistent shortages driving demand for <strong>nurses, physicians, and allied health professionals</strong> across all provinces. Natural resources — oil and gas in Alberta, mining in Ontario and British Columbia, and forestry in British Columbia — remain foundational to the economy. Financial services, construction, and the public sector are also consistently active hiring markets.</p>

Vancouver is a hub for technology, film production, and natural resources, with a particularly strong gaming and software sector. Calgary is the centre of the Canadian oil and gas industry and is diversifying aggressively into tech.

The <strong>Express Entry system</strong> manages applications for permanent residence across the Federal Skilled Worker Program, Federal Skilled Trades Program, and Canadian Experience Class. The <strong>Provincial Nominee Program (PNP)</strong> allows provinces to directly nominate workers in high-demand occupations. Temporary Foreign Worker Programs and International Mobility Programs provide pathways for those seeking <strong>work permit jobs in Canada</strong>. Many Canadian employers on JobMeter indicate whether they support LMIA or work permit applications.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Salary Expectations for Jobs in Canada</h3>
